***

Note: This challenge has been over for almost a decade; why are you still looking at it?

This repository contains a round-up of all you need to start the 2010 Google AI Challenge Planet Wars (hereinafter 
Planet Wars Challenge) originally run by the University of Waterloo.

Getting Started
---------------

Under `starterbots/` are slimmed down versions of the official starter packages for C++, C#, Java and Python.

Pick your language of choice and copy the contents to the root folder.
What you have is a bot with a very basic strategy.
Look at the file `MyBot.*` (different file extensions depending on programming language) to understand the basic 
strategy of the bot and how communication with the game engine works.

Look at `SPECIFICATION.md` for the official specifications of the game.

### Playing Games

Included in this starter package are two game playing scripts.

*  `play.py` for playing an individual game from a randomly generated map and viewing it.
*  `play_multiple.py` for playing multiple games on multiple randomly generated maps.
